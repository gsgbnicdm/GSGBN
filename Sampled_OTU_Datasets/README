This is a sampled version of microbial dataset from The ICoMM project (The International Census of Marine Microbes).

The "OTUTop50.txt" and "OTUTop100.txt" contain the matrix for top 50 and top 100 abundant OTUs ((operational taxonomy units) for the this dataset.
Each row of the matrix represents a sample and each column represents the abundance of an OTU.

*Please standardized the dataset with zero mean and unit variance before you run GSGBN.

Example: 

Standardized the dataset with zero mean and unit variance.
Random pick 200 samples (e.g. input200.txt) for training the model, the last 71 samples for testing.

GSGBN -i input200.txt -l1 20.0 -l2 5.0 -num 5 -thr 0.01

lambda1 = 20.0 is for sparsity, lambda2 = 5.0 * n (e.g. 50, 100) for grouping, 0.01 is the threshold for filtering.
