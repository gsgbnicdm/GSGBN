Those eight datasets are simulated from the Bayesian Network Repository (http://www.bnlearn.com/)
For details of simulation please refer to our paper.

*Please DO NOT standardized the datasets because:
We generate the regression parameter matrix (B) and data matrix (X) from the original network 
with only known skeleton. If we normalize the data, the parameter (B) may change.

If you want to run the Water dataset (50 samples, 28 variables)
