Those eight datasets are simulated from the Bayesian Network Repository (http://www.bnlearn.com/)
For details of simulation please refer to our paper.

*Please DO NOT standardized the datasets because:
We generate the regression parameter matrix (B) and data matrix (X) from the original network 
with only known skeleton. If we normalize the data, the parameter (B) may change.

Example:
If you want to run the Water dataset (50 samples, 28 variables),
please type:
GSGBN -i Water.txt -l1 1.0 -l2 0.1 -n 10 -thr 0.1 

You can also try different parameters (cross validation) to choose the best model.

*Note:
After you run the GSGBN and obtain the parameter matrix, please filter out those edges with regression coefficients less than 0.3. 
For details, please refer to our paper.
